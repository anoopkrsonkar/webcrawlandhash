This project include two things-
1- Webcrawler
2- Reverse Hash function

 -webcrawler has two features 
 1- find total number of result for keyword
 2- find the name of all result find for a keyword and page no

 I have used following packges-

 express

 If you want try this you can use this web crawler for data extracting from different website and store it to database using mongodb or SQL by making some modification.

 -reversehash reverse the hash value and provide the text string..
